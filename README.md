# minbrowser-arm-builds

Thanks to the merge of [minbrowser/min pull #1813](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/pull/1813), official arm packages are now provided on the main min repository! Because of this, I am archiving this repository since it isn't needed anymore.

To install min, get the latest deb package and install it from [here](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/releases/latest).
